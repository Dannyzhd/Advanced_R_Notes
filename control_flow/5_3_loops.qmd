# 5.3 Loops

### for loops basic form

```{r, eval=FALSE}
for (item in vector) perform_action
```

For each item in `vector`, `perform_action` is called once; updating the value of `item` each time.

**Tip:**

(When iterating over a vector of indices, it's conventional to use very short variable names like `i`, `j`, or `k`.)

N.B.: `for` assigns the `item` to the current environment, overwriting any existing variable with the same name

```{r}
i <- 100
for (i in 1:3) {}
i

```

### terminate a `for` loop early

-   `next` exits the current iteration.

-   `break` exits the entire `for` loop.

```{r}
for(i in 1:10000){
  if( i < 10) next
  print(i)
  if(i >= 13) break
}
```
