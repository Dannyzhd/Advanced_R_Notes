# Summary

Every column means a type of return, governed by a family

and based on different number/type of arguments, every family has a series of members.

# 9.4.1 **`modify()`: Same type of output as input:**

How do we double every column in a dataframe?

map would return us a list instead of a dataframe we want.

```{r}
df <- data.frame(
  a <- 1:10,
  b <- 25:16
)

map(df, ~.x * 2)


```

## modify

We can use `modify()` to keep the [output the same type as input]{.underline}

```{r}
(df <- modify(df, .f = ~.x * 2))
```

-   as indicated above, modify [does not modify in place,]{.underline} meaning we need to assign if we want to preserve the modified value.

Core of `modify` is basically:

```{r}
simple_modify <- function(x, f, ...) {
  for (i in seq_along(x)) {
    x[[i]] <- f(x[[i]], ...)
  }
  x
} # simplified a little bit than the actual one.
```

## modify_if

what about a mixed dataframe with both character columns and numeric columns?

we can use `modify_if()` to only modify the numeric ones.

```{r}
modify_if(iris, .p = is.numeric, .f = ~.x * 100) %>% as_tibble()
```

# **9.4.2 `map2()` and friends: 2 inputs**

Recall `map()` only [vectorise]{.underline} the .x, for the rest arguments fed to .f, even if they are in vector forms, they remain the same instead of being vectorised.

![](images/map-arg-recycle_1.png)

But what if we need to be able to provide the extra argument as a vector?\
For example, sometimes we want to calculate mean for each group [by weights]{.underline}

```{r}
# 8 groups of 10 numbers
sample_data_points <- map(1:8, ~ runif(10))

sample_data_points[[1]][1] <- NA

# 8 groups of weights, each weight is a vector of length 10 corresponding to the 10 numbers in the group.
weight <- map(1:8, ~ rpois(n = 10, lambda =  5) + 1)

```

For one group we just do

```{r}
sample_data_points[[2]] %>% 
  weighted.mean(w = weight[[2]])
```

To calculate weighted mean for all groups, we will face Error if we go for `map()`

```{r eval = F}
map_dbl(sample_data_points, .f = weighted.mean, w = weight)

# Error: ! 'x' and 'w' must have the same length
```

This is because, for each group, weight is not vectorised and simply fed to w as a list of weights.

## map2

`map2()` can help: it is vectorised over two arguments. This means both `.x` and `.y` are varied in each call to `.f`:

```{r}
map2_dbl(.x = sample_data_points, 
         .y = weight, 
         .f = weighted.mean)

```

![](images/map2.png)

### Compared to map()

two vectors come before the function, rather than one. Additional arguments still go afterwards

![](images/map2-arg.png)

### nice property: recycling .y

map2 recycles .y when its length is not sufficient, meaning if .y is of length 1, map2(x, y, f) is essentially equivalent to map(x, f, y)

![](images/map2-recycle.png)

# 9.4.3 **`walk()` and friends: No outputs**

Most functions are called for the value that they return, so it makes sense to capture and store the value with a [`map()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/map.html) function. But some functions are called primarily for their side-effects(e.g. [`cat()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/cat.html), [`write.csv()`](https://rdrr.io/r/utils/write.table.html), or `ggsave()`)

```{r}
names <- c("Danny", "Daniel")
map(names, ~ print(paste0("Hello, ", .x) ))

```

The main purpose is to print the message to users. Returning a list is somewhat redundant.

We can muffle the ouput by assigning the value to a variable we will never use.

```{r}
useless_variable <- map(names, ~ print(paste0("Hello, ", .x) ))

```

But this makes our code hard to read and not purpose-clear.

## walk

`walk` ignores the return values of the `.f` and instead [return `.x` invisibly]{.underline}

```{r}
walk(names, ~ print(paste0("Hello, ", .x) ))
```

![](images/walk.png)

## walk2

Very useful! As we often want to output a file for each of the element in a list. And that requires a pair of arguments, the object and the path that you want to save it to.

![](images/walk2.png)

\
For example we have some dataframes we want to output respectively as .csv into a folder.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# assign a path to store the output files.
path_folder <- "/Users/handingzhang/Desktop/Advanced_R_Notes/functional/9_4_output"
if(!file.exists(path_folder)) dir.create(path_folder)

# split the dfs, each to be written to a csv in the path.
cyls <- split(mtcars, mtcars$cyl)

# create a vector of paths for the outputs to go to.
csv_paths <- file.path(path_folder, 
                   paste0("cyl-", 
                          names(cyls), 
                          ".csv") # make the file name for each csv using the df name.
                   )

# walk2 would iterate through the dataframes and write them out as csv.
walk2(.x = cyls, .y = csv_paths, .f = write.csv)

# check the files in the folder to make sure they have created!
dir(path_folder)
#> [1] "cyl-4.csv" "cyl-6.csv" "cyl-8.csv"
```

Here the [`walk2()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/map2.html) is equivalent to [`write.csv(cyls[[1]], paths[[1]])`](https://rdrr.io/r/utils/write.table.html), [`write.csv(cyls[[2]], paths[[2]])`](https://rdrr.io/r/utils/write.table.html), [`write.csv(cyls[[3]], paths[[3]])`](https://rdrr.io/r/utils/write.table.html).

# **9.4.4 Iterating over values and indices**

There are three basic ways to loop over a vector with a for loop:

-   Loop over the elements: `for (x in xs)`

-   Loop over the numeric indices: `for (i in seq_along(xs))`

-   Loop over the names: `for (nm in names(xs))`

The first form is analogous to the [`map()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/map.html) family.

## imap

The second and third forms are equivalent to the [`imap()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/imap.html) family which allows you to iterate over the values and the indices of a vector in parallel

### properties

[`imap(x, f)`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/imap.html) is equivalent to [`map2(x, names(x), f)`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/map2.html) if x has names.

[`imap(x, f)`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/imap.html) is equivalent to [`map2(x, seq_along(x), f)`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/map2.html) if x has no names.

### over names

recall a dataframe is essentially a list of same-length, named vectors.

```{r}
imap_chr(iris, ~ paste0("The first value of ", .y, " is ", .x[[1]]))
```

basically using `imap()`, we have access to `.y`

another example:

```{r}
imap(.x = mtcars, .f = function(x, y){paste0("Index(name) is: ", y, ". Corresponding column has first value as: ", x[[1]])})
```

### over indices

If the vector is unnamed, the second argument will be the index:

```{r}

# generate 6 groups of 10 numbers.
x <- map(1:6, ~ sample(x = 1000, size = 10))

imap_chr(x, ~ paste0("The highest value of the ", .y, "th group is ", max(.x)))


```

[`imap()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/imap.html) is a useful helper if you want to work with the values in a vector along with their positions.

# **9.4.5 `pmap()` and friends: Any number of inputs**

## pmap

Instead of generalising [`map2()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/map2.html) to an arbitrary number of arguments, purrr takes a slightly different tack with [`pmap()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/map2.html): you supply it a single list, which contains any number of arguments. In most cases, that will be a list of equal-length vectors, i.e. something very similar to a data frame.

![](images/pmap.png)

Thus:

[`map2(x, y, f)`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/map2.html) is equivalent to [`pmap(list(x, y), f)`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/map2.html)

Let's use the previous example in map2()

```{r}

# sample_data_points: list 8 groups of 10 numbers, with the first group containing NA.
# weight: list of 8 groups of weights, each weight is a vector of length 10 corresponding to the 10 numbers in the group.

pmap_dbl(list(sample_data_points, weight), weighted.mean)
#> [1]    NA 0.451 0.603 0.452 0.563 0.510 0.342 0.464
```

Just as in `map2()` , the exatra constant argument(s) can come after.

```{r}
pmap_dbl(list(sample_data_points, weight), weighted.mean, na.rm = T)
```

![](images/pmap-arg.png)

### name the argument in the list

We have nice control over the arguments as we can name the elements in the `.l` list that contains the arguments to feed into the `.f`

```{r}
trims <- c(0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5)
x <- rcauchy(1000)

pmap_dbl(list(trim = trims), mean, x = x)
#> [1] -6.6740  0.0210  0.0235  0.0151
```

making it crystal clear that for the .f = mean, the trim argument is supplied with trims vector as value. x argument is supplied with x as value.

whereas if we do equivalently in `map_dbl()`

```{r}
map_dbl(.x = trims, 
        .f = mean, 
        x = x)
```

we are counting on the reader or ourselves to remember that the first argument after `x` is `trim` in the mean() function for this call to make sense.

### tip:

it's good practice to name the components of the list to make it very clear how the function will be called.

### argument dataframe!

It's often convenient to call [`pmap()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/map2.html) with a data frame. A handy way to create that data frame is with [`tibble::tribble()`](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/reference/tribble.html)

Because thereby we can describe the arguments row by row, less likely to make mistakes!

Each row essentially corresponds to one **linear combination of arguments t**o a call of **.f**

Example:

```{r}
# Recall dplyr::tribble is a good way to create small and easy-to-read tibbles in a row-by-row style.
params <- dplyr::tribble(
  ~ n, ~ min, ~ max,
   1L,     0,     1,
   2L,    10,   100,
   3L,   100,  1000
)

pmap(params, runif)
```

![](images/pmap-3.png)

In the above example then, `pmap(params, runif)` is equivalent to [`runif(n = 1L, min = 0, max = 1)`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/Uniform.html), [`runif(n = 2, min = 10, max = 100)`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/Uniform.html), [`runif(n = 3L, min = 100, max = 1000)`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/Uniform.html)

if the names of the argument dataframe does not match well with the `.f function` . Simply use dplyr::rename to remedy.

# 9.4.6 Exercises

## Q1

1.  Explain the results of [`modify(mtcars, 1)`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/modify.html).

    ```{r}
    modify(mtcars,1)
    ```

Well we take a look at `as_mapper(1)` and know that basically `modify(mtcars, .f = 1)` is essentially indexing position 1 for us using `pluck_raw` in elements of the list, mtcars, which are the columns. So we see the value of the first element in each column in our output. Meanwhile modify() tries to maintain the structure of the output to be the same as the input, which is a dataframe of 32 rows. Thus it recycles the index of length one 32 times. Eventually showed us the 32 rows of the same value, the first element of each column.

[official solution](https://advanced-r-solutions.rbind.io/functionals#map-variants)

## Q2

Rewrite the following code to use [`iwalk()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/imap.html) instead of [`walk2()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/map2.html). What are the advantages and disadvantages?

```{r}
# author did this earlier
temp <- tempfile()
dir.create(temp)

cyls <- split(mtcars, mtcars$cyl)
paths <- file.path(temp, paste0("cyl-", names(cyls), ".csv"))
walk2(cyls, paths, write.csv)

dir(temp)
list.files(temp)
```

let's use iwalk

```{r}
#reset the folder
unlink(temp)
temp <- tempfile()
dir.create(temp)

# make sure it is empty.
dir(temp)

# recreate the path names based on the new tempfile.
paths <- file.path(temp, paste0("cyl-", names(cyls), ".csv"))


iwalk(paths, .f = ~write.csv(x = cyls[[.y]], file = .x))


# check to ensure they are correctly created.
dir(temp)
```

### book solution

**A**: [`iwalk()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/imap.html) allows us to use a single variable, storing the output path in the names.

```         
temp <- tempfile()
dir.create(temp)

cyls <- split(mtcars, mtcars$cyl)
names(cyls) <- file.path(temp, paste0("cyl-", names(cyls), ".csv"))
iwalk(cyls, ~ write.csv(.x, .y))
```

Copy

We could do this in a single pipe by taking advantage of [`set_names()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/set_names.html):

```         
mtcars %>%
  split(mtcars$cyl) %>%
  set_names(~ file.path(temp, paste0("cyl-", .x, ".csv"))) %>%
  iwalk(~ write.csv(.x, .y))
```

## Q3

2.  Explain how the following code transforms a data frame using functions stored in a list.

```{r}
trans <- list(
  disp = function(x) x * 0.0163871,
  am = function(x) factor(x, labels = c("auto", "manual"))
)

nm <- names(trans)
mtcars[nm] <- map2(trans, mtcars[nm], function(f, var) f(var))
```

Compare and contrast the [`map2()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/map2.html) approach to this [`map()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/map.html) approach:

```{r}
# reset mtcars
data(mtcars)

(mtcars[nm] <- map(nm, ~ trans[[.x]](mtcars[[.x]])))
```

### my solution

Basically `trans` stores two named functions with names corresponding to 2 column names in mtcars. Each name corresponds to the index of the column and the function for the actions we want to take with that column.

`nm` then serves as the vector of the column names we will index.

finally, `map2(trans, mtcars[nm], function(f, var) f(var))` basically align the name of the function with the column with the same name, creating two modified columns.

In the alternative way `mtcars[nm] <- map(nm, ~ trans[.x])` nm is serving as both the function names to index from our function list, `trans` and the column names to index from the dataframe. This way also works but we can easily make mistakes if even one pair of name of the function in `trans` and name of the column in `mtcars` are not perfectly matching.

### book solution

**A**: In the first approach

```{r eval=FALSE}
mtcars[nm] <- map2(trans, mtcars[nm], function(f, var) f(var))
```

the list of the 2 functions (`trans`) and the 2 appropriately selected data frame columns (`mtcars[nm]`) are supplied to [`map2()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/map2.html). [`map2()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/map2.html) creates an anonymous function (`f(var)`) which applies the functions to the variables when [`map2()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/map2.html) iterates over their (similar) indices. On the left-hand side, the respective 2 elements of `mtcars` are being replaced by their new transformations.

The [`map()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/map.html) variant

```{r eval=FALSE}
mtcars[nm] <- map(nm, ~ trans[[.x]](mtcars[[.x]]))
```

does basically the same. However, it directly iterates over the names (`nm`) of the transformations. Therefore, the data frame columns are selected during the iteration.

Besides the iteration pattern, the approaches differ in the possibilities for appropriate argument naming in the `.f` argument. In the [`map2()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/map2.html) approach we iterate over the elements of `x` and `y`. Therefore, it is possible to choose appropriate placeholders like `f` and `var`. This makes the anonymous function more expressive at the cost of making it longer. We think using the formula interface in this way is preferable compared to the rather cryptic `mtcars[nm] <- map2(trans, mtcars[nm], ~ .x(.y))`.

In the [`map()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/map.html) approach we map over the variable names. It is therefore not possible to introduce placeholders for the function and variable names. The formula syntax together with the `.x` pronoun is pretty compact. The object names and the brackets clearly indicate the application of transformations to specific columns of `mtcars`. In this case the iteration over the variable names comes in handy, as it highlights the importance of matching between `trans` and `mtcars` element names. Together with the replacement form on the left-hand side, this line is relatively easy to inspect.

To summarise, in situations where [`map()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/map.html) and [`map2()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/map2.html) provide solutions for an iteration problem, several points may be considered before deciding for one or the other approach.

## Q4

**Q4**: What does [`write.csv()`](https://rdrr.io/r/utils/write.table.html) return, i.e. what happens if you use it with [`map2()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/map2.html) instead of [`walk2()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/map2.html)?

**A**: [`write.csv()`](https://rdrr.io/r/utils/write.table.html) returns `NULL`. As we call the function for its side effect (creating a CSV file), [`walk2()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/map2.html) would be appropriate here. Otherwise, we receive a rather uninformative list of `NULL`s.

```{r}
cyls <- split(mtcars, mtcars$cyl)

temp1 <- tempfile()
dir.create(temp1)

paths <- file.path(temp1, paste0("cyl-", names(cyls), ".csv"))

map2(cyls, paths, write.csv)
```
